Analytics Engineering dotfiles for an M1 Mac

## Setup Steps

Open your new mac and go through all the setup screens - this takes a little while.

Once complete, you'll need iTerm2. Go to https://iterm2.com/ and download it.
When I did this, I got notified that I needed to install:
* Developer tools
* Message about installing pip3
Let's hope neither of those cause problems later
