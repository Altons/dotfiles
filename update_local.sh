# .zsh files in dotfiles/oh-my-zsh have remote changes because they are symlinked
# files removed from the remote will remain in the ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom directory
# unless they are removed
# To remove files you no longer want, use 
# rm ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/file-to-remove.zsh
# To remove all symlinks in the oh-my-zsh/custom directory use
# find ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom -type l | xargs rm
