# VS Code Configurations

## VSCode Extensions and Settings

The dotfiles will install a number of extensions I like, including the following:

* vscode-dbt-power-user which also installs jinjahtml and vscode-dbt
* code-spell-checker - settings ensure only `.md` and `.yml` files are checked
* Utilities like pydocstring, rainbow-csv, vscode-markdownlint, and openmatchingfiles
* Python extensions

The settings file is a combination of things I already had and some things I
picked up from [Anders' discourse post](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/setting-up-vscode-to-use-with-the-dbt-cli/3291)

* Showing white spaces as dots
* Making modified files easier to see
* A ruler at 80 characters
* black for Python formatting and format on save
